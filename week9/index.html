		<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p class="question">Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</p>
				<p class="answer">There are quite a few websites that I really like, design-wise. <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a>, <a href="http://www.fusion.net">Fusion</a> and <a href="http://www.zara.com">Zara</a> all have very pretty designs - lots of negative space, an emphasis on large, beautiful images. I also used <a href="http://www.cityarts.net">City Arts and Lectures</a> as an example of what a similar organization has done for their site.</p>
			<p class="question">Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</p>
				<p class="answer">I like the simplicity of the design, the clean lines and white space. I was trying to steer clear of something overcomplicated, something too busy.</p>
			<p class="question">What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</p>
				<p class="answer">Figuring out how to illustrate all the different aspects of the site in a simple, attractive way was pretty hard. There are so many components to the website, particularly on the "Attend" page where we'll have a lot of different events listed. Deciding how to create something clean and user friendly was difficult since there are so many ways that the events could be filtered.</p>
			<p class="question">Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</p>
				<p class="answer">Floats were probably the most challenging and frustrating. Making the page responsive also took a lot of trial and error.</p>
			<p class="question">What did you learn from making your project responsive?</p>
				<p class="answer">That even a web design that seems simple at a large browser size is probably not simple enough for a small browser. As things shrunk, most of the page had to disappear in order for everything to make sense/look good.</p>

		<h2>Reviews</h2>
			<h3>Group 1</h3>
				<p class="reviewanswer">I think <a href="http://squarespace.com/home/overview/">Squarespace</a> has a really lovely site. Has a nice balance with the main headline on the left and the three example devices on the right (each increasing in size as you move to the right side of the page). The main navigation bar is clean, simple, centered on the page. The hamburger nav and login at the top right gets a little lost in the image, but is still easy to figure out.</p>
				<p class="reviewanswer">As you scroll down the page, I love how the desktop outline stays the same as the web design example on the desktop's browser changes. Nice fade as you move to each section.</p>
				<p class="reviewanswer">I like the fonts that are used, and the balance between all caps and regular. I also love the super subtle color scheme, though I can see how one might find that all the colors are a bit too similar (makes some of the images a little harder to see). The best part of the site, though, is probably the quality of the images. Really nice, very eye-catching.</p>
			<h3>Group 2</h3>
				<p class="reviewanswer">Ah, <a href="http://www.spectrumpowderworks.com/">Spectrum Powderworks</a>... To begin, the logo is super poor quality, and whatever font was chosen for the logo isn't terribly attractive. It's also confusing to have the navigation bar at the bottom of the page, rather than the top.</p>
				<p class="reviewanswer">All the images on the site seem to be very low quality, nothing is crisp and clear, and clip art seems to be used for the "Home" button on other pages.</p>
				<p class="reviewanswer">As you click through the other pages, there isn't really a site map that makes sense - some pages don't link back to all the other pages, the navigation bar is only visible on certain pages and sometimes it's only part of the navigation bar. The background colors change around randomly and on the "Colors" page the images at the top of the page are clearly distorted/stretched. That page also doesn't match any of the others on the site.</p>
				<p class="reviewanswer">Overall, I think this site could use some updating. Could use a more modern look, and consistency among all the pages.</p>
